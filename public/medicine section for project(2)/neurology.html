    <h5 style="text-indent: 1em;margin-left: 20px;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system. The nervous system is a complex, sophisticated system that regulates and coordinates body activities. It has two major divisions:
<ul><li>
Central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord</li><li>
Peripheral nervous system: all other neural elements, such as eyes, ears, skin, and other "sensory receptors"</li>
</ul>A doctor who specializes in neurology is called a neurologist. The neurologist treats disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, such as:<ul>
<li>
Cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke</li><li>
Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis</li><li>
Headache disorders</li><li>
Infections of the brain and peripheral nervous system</li><li>
Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease</li><li>
Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease)</li><li>
Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy</li><li>
Spinal cord disorders</li><li>
Speech and language disorders</li></ul>
Neurologists do not perform surgery. If one of their patients requires surgery, they refer them to a neurosurgeon.

    <h5  style="margin-left: 20px;text-indent: 1em;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">
        During a neurological examination, the neurologist reviews the patient's health history with special attention to the current condition. The patient then takes a neurological exam. Typically, the exam tests mental status, function of the cranial nerves (including vision), strength, coordination, reflexes, and sensation. This information helps the neurologist determine whether the problem exists in the nervous system and the clinical localization. Localization of the pathology is the key process by which neurologists develop their differential diagnosis. Further tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis and ultimately guide therapy and appropriate management.</h5><hr class="accessory"><br>

<br><br>
In the United States and Canada, neurologists are physicians having completed postgraduate training in neurology after graduation from medical school. Neurologists complete, on average, about 8 years of medical college education and clinical training, which includes obtaining a four-year undergraduate degree, a medical degree (DO or MD), which comprises an additional four years of study, then completing one year of basic clinical training and four years of residency. <sup>[8]</sup> The four-year residency consists of one year of internal medicine internship training followed by three years of training in neurology.
<br><br>
Some neurologists receive additional subspecialty training focusing on a particular area of the fields. These training programs are called fellowships, and are one to two years in duration. Subspecialties include brain injury medicine, clinical neurophysiology, epilepsy, hospice and palliative medicine, neurodevelopmental disabilities, neuromuscular medicine, pain medicine, sleep medicine, neurocritical care, vascular neurology (stroke),<sup>[9]</sup> behavioral neurology, child neurology, headache, multiple sclerosis, neuroimaging, neurorehabilitation.
<br><br>
In Germany, a compulsory year of psychiatry must be done to complete a residency of neurology.<sup>[10]</sup>
<br><br>
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, neurology is a subspecialty of general (internal) medicine. After five years of medical school and two years as a Foundation Trainee, an aspiring neurologist must pass the examination for Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (or the Irish equivalent) and complete two years of core medical training before entering specialist training in neurology. Up to the 1960s, some intending to become neurologists would also spend two years working in psychiatric units before obtaining a diploma in psychological medicine. However, that was uncommon and, now that the MRCPsych takes three years to obtain, would no longer be practical. A period of research is essential, and obtaining a higher degree aids career progression. Many found it was eased after an attachment to the Institute of Neurology at Queen Square, London. Some neurologists enter the field of rehabilitation medicine (known as physiatry in the US) to specialise in neurological rehabilitation, which may include stroke medicine, as well as brain injuries.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></h5>
