   <strong class="animate__animated animate__jackInTheBox bg-info" >Defination</strong><br>
    <h5 style="text-indent: 1em;margin-left: 20px;" class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp">The term bariatrics was coined around 1965,[2] from the Greek root bar- ("weight" as in barometer), suffix -iatr ("treatment," as in pediatrics), and suffix -ic ("pertaining to"). The field encompasses dieting, exercise and behavioral therapy approaches to weight loss, as well as pharmacotherapy and surgery. The term is also used in the medical field as somewhat of a euphemism to refer to people of larger sizes without regard to their participation in any treatment specific to weight loss, such as medical supply catalogs featuring larger hospital gowns and hospital beds referred to as "bariatric".

        Being overweight or obese are both rising medical problems.<sup>[3][4] </sup>There are many detrimental health effects of obesity:[5][6] Individuals with a BMI (Body Mass Index) exceeding a healthy range have a much greater risk of medical issues.<sup>[7]</sup> These include heart disease, diabetes mellitus, many types of cancer, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic musculoskeletal problems. There is also a focus on the correlation between obesity and mortality.<sup>[8]</sup><br>

Overweight and obese people, including children, may find it difficult to lose weight on their own.<sup>[9] </sup>It is common for dieters to have tried fad diets only to find that they gain weight, or return to their original weight, after ceasing the diet.<sup>[10]</sup> Some improvement in patient psychological health is noted after bariatric surgery.[11] It should also be noted that 51% of bariatric surgery candidates report a history of mental illness, specifically depression, as well as being prescribed at least one psychotropic medication at the time of their surgery candidacy.<sup>[12][13]</sup>

The combination of approaches used may be tailored to each patient.[18] Bariatric treatments in youth must be considered with great caution and with other conditions that may not have to be considered in adults. <br>

Techniques used in bariatrics include bioelectrical impedance analysis, a method to measure body fat percentage.</h5>
